# NFC-Mimic
A test program to mimic ISO 14443-A based tags.

The initial goal is to try to mimic ISO 14443-A based tags within an Android system's own environment, using only preinstalled libraries (e.g. no NXP porting) and Python. The program can be compiled using Buildozer.
The program is still in early developement and acts as a learning guide for me (and possibly others) to the Android system and NFC chips in general.

NOTE: The codebase is messy, as this program is still in personal developement. The comments will be translated later into English and the codebase will be cleaned and modularized later.
